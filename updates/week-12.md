## More Temporal Analysis

### Hours of Day
Somehow I forgot to measure noise complaint frequency by hour of the day, so I took care of that quickly. I made a new function to slice the 'Created_Date' column in order to get the hour, and I made a graph in MatPlotLib to display the frequency of 311 noise complaints by hour of the day.

Not that surprisingly, calls were most frequent during 11 PM, 10 PM, and midnight respectively.
