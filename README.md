# Find Food NYC
## Project Proposal

For my project in COMS BC 3997, I plan to build a database-backed website that provides up-to-date, accessible information on food pantries, soup kitchens, food banks, and community fridges open in New York City.

### Why is this important?
Food insecurity is reaching historic highs in New York City with a 69% increase in visits to food pantries and soup kitchens from 2019 to 2022 according to [City Harvest](https://www.cityharvest.org/food-insecurity/). Currently, 1.5 million New Yorkers are experiencing food insecurity, including 1 in 4 children. Within communities of immigrants and ethnic minorities, levels of food security are especially high with [31% of immigrants living in food-insecure households](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/how-are-immigrants-faring-after-welfare-reform). Community food pantries directly serve local residents facing food insecurity, and they are often one of the only sources of nutritious food in a neighborhood. They support low-income families, the homeless, and other vulnerable populations by promoting health and wellbeing. Food pantries can also provide additional resources like health screenings, back to school supplies, baby formula, and more. 

Despite the benefits and importance of these resources, there are still barriers to access for these resources. For instance, pantry hours are often extremely limited with one study showing that [53% of food pantries in the Bronx were open 3 hours per week or less] (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11524-012-9750-2). In this same study, listed hours and location on the Food Bank website were incorrect almost half of the time.
