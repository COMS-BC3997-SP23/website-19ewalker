## Project Proposal

For my project in COMS BC 3997, I plan to build a database-backed website that allows users to easily search data on violations and service requests at NYCHA developments.

### Why is this important?
Conditions in NYC housing projects have been [deteriorating over the past couple of decades](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/25/nyregion/new-york-city-public-housing-history.html) due to years of disinvestment of billions of dollars across all levels of government. In the early 2000s, the combination of this mass divestment in public housing and the rising costs to renovate and maintain buildings caused living conditions to take a turn for the worse, starting a cycle of cover-ups and a huge backlog of service requests. These conditions are reaching a fever pitch right now, with the NYCHA having [680K+ open work orders](https://eapps.nycha.info/NychaMetrics/Charts/PublicHousingChartsTabs/?section=public_housing&tab=tab_repairs)—their manageable workload is 90K open work orders. This backlog has real consequences for residents of NYCHA developments—waiting months for repairs, and living with the crumbling walls, leaks, and lack of hot water in the meantime. Currently, there's no easy way to track and visualize these open work orders and how conditions fare across housing projects.

### Goals and Objectives

My goal is to create a centralized site in order to easily view current work orders across developments in NYCHA's housing projects. I would ideally like my final site to have a map page where people can navigate between different housing developments and see the different work orders open at each building. There would also be filters to see, for example, which buildings had current exterminator service requests, etc. There will also be a search page where people can search for a particular NYCHA building and see all open work orders. 

If I have time at the end, I would also like to complete some data analysis/visualization in order to determine some of the most common service requests, the average response time, maybe even some predictive analysis if I have time to learn that!
