## Project Week 8 (aka Check-In Time)

My name is Elizabeth, and I'm a senior in CS at SEAS.

Here's a brief rundown of what I've been up to with this project. My goal is to analyze differences in 311 noise complaint activity in New York City 
that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I came in with a couple of hypotheses that I wanted to explore. 

1. I believed that NYCâ€™s 311 Call Center received on average **more complaints about noises** in the first three months of the pandemic than the Call Center received in the same period during 2019.
2. Meanwhile, I believe the call center will receive on average **less complaints about commercial, vehicle, and street/sidewalk noise** in these first three months compared to the same period in 2019.
3. During this three month period, I believe that **low-income zip codes will experience/report more monthly noise complaints** on average compared to medium-to-high-income zip codes.
