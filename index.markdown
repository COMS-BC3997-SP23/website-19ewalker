# 311 Data Project

For my project in COMS BC 3997, I plan to build a website supported by the NYC 311 Call database in order to analyze and visualize 311 service requests in New York City over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this project, I plan to combine data with city history in order to see how city residents' living situations, anxieties, and needs changed in accordance with landmark moments throughout the pandemic.

Keep checking my site to stay updated on progress!
